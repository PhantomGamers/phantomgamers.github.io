SUWSF (Somewhat Universal Widescreen Fix) is a patcher that can be dropped next to any game executable with its patches configured in an ini file directly next to it.

The patches are made to be simple to edit so that anyone can easily transfer hex edit tutorials into an SUWSF config so that the fixes can be more easily installed.

SUWSF also patches the game's memory instead of patching the executable file on the disk, so it can persist between game updates as long as the patch patterns are still valid, and all modifications can be disabled either by removing SUWSF's files or by disabling patches either globally or individually in the config file.
