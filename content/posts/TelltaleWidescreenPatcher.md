Telltale Widescreen Patcher is a GUI interface that automates patching games made with the classic Telltale engine to work with ultrawide and wider resolutions.

It was made with the intention of working with all of the Telltale titles since they all use a similar engine and require similar fixes. Certain titles do not work properly with the fix, but for those titles other fixes are already available.
