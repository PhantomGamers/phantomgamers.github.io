## Projects -- Pull Requests Welcome!
* [EnableNewSteamFriendsSkin](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/EnableNewSteamFriendsSkin) - Name is WIP. This program allows you to patch your friends.css file in order to enable loading of custom skins for the new 2018 Steam friends UI.

* [SteamConfigPatcher](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SteamConfigPatcher) - This utility allows you to modify settings for the Steam client that aren't currently exposed in the GUI. In the future I'd like to make this more useful by adding a GUI and allowing changes to all of Steam's settings, not just the hidden options.

* [GTA5HK](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/GTA5HK) - This script for autohotkey allows you to automate some functions in GTA 5 Online such as popping snacks for HP and equipping body armor. Hasn't been updated in a while, likely has some issues on the latest version of GTA 5. I will update this on request or when I get the itch.
